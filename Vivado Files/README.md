# Vivado Files
Following folder contains the fullt Vivado file to run our hardware model on both Basys 3 and Nexus 7 FPGA boards.

- **Basys**: Contains the full working verilog file for the Basys 3 FPGA board that does all functions as shown in our demo video.

- **Nexus**: Contains the verilog file for the Nexus 7 FPGA board. All functions up to grey scale and edge detection is working, but no object detection was implemented on the Nexus version.
